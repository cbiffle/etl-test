ETL Tests
=========

This contains test and example code for the ETL.

To prepare a fresh clone, run bootstrap.sh.

To build:

    $ cd build
    $ ./cobble build

To run tests:

    $ cd build
    $ latest/test/all_tests

To clean:

    $ rm -rf build

In case of weird sticky build failures involving Python stack traces, clean and
re-run bootstrap.sh.
